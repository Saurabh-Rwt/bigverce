                                and your device (e.g., your IP address, cookie identifiers, page(s) visited, location,
                                time of day). These advertising partners may use this information (and similar
                                information collected from other services) for purposes of delivering personalized
                                advertisements to you when you visit digital properties within their networks. This
                                practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “personalised

                            If we transfer personal information to countries outside the European Economic Area, we will
                            put in place appropriate safeguards to ensure that this transfer complies with the

                            Authorised Agent. Only you, or someone legally authorised to act on your behalf, may make a
                            verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a
                            verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. To designate an authorised agent,
                            please contact us as set forth in “Contact Us” below and provide written authorisation
                            signed by you and your designated agent.

                            Verification. To protect your privacy, we will take the following steps to verify your
                            identity before fulfilling your request. When you make a request, we will ask you to provide
                            sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we
                            collected personal information or an authorised representative, which may include [asking
                            you to answer questions, for example, regarding your name and email address.

                            If you are a California resident and would like to exercise any of your rights under the

                            Refer-a-Friend and Similar Incentive Programs. As described above in “How We Use Your
                            Personal Information” (“Share Content with Friends or Colleagues”), we may offer referral
                            programs or other incentivised data collection programs. For example, we may offer
                            incentives to you such as discounts or promotional items or credit in connection with these
                            programs, wherein you provide your personal information in exchange for a reward, or provide
                            personal information regarding your friends or colleagues (such as their email address) and
                            receive rewards when they sign up to use our Services. (The referred party may also receive
                            rewards for signing up via your referral.) These programs are entirely voluntary and allow
                            us to grow our business and provide additional benefits to you. The value of your data to us
                            depends on how you ultimately use our Services, whereas the value of the referred party’s
                            data to us depends on whether the referred party ultimately becomes a User/Customer and uses
                            our Services. The said value will be reflected in the incentive offered in connection with
                            each program.

                            Accessibility. This Privacy Policy uses industry-standard technologies and was developed in

                            below. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information in
                            violation of applicable law, we will delete any personal information we have collected,
                            unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and terminate the child’s account.

                        <p> These Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Policy referenced herein represent the entire
                            understanding between you and Company regarding your relationship with Company and this
                            Website and supersede any prior statements or representations. If any provision of these
                            Terms and Conditions, or portion thereof, is determined to be unenforceable, that provision
                            shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the Terms
                            and Conditions and the remainder of the Terms and Conditions shall continue in full force
                            and effect. The company’s failure to enforce any provision of these Terms and Conditions
                            shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision nor of the Company's right to enforce such
                            provision. The company reserves the right to change the Terms and Conditions at any time by
                            posting changes online. Your non-termination or continued use of the Website after changes
                            are posted constitutes your acceptance of the Terms and Conditions as modified by the posted
                            changes. </p>
