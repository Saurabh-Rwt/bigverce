                            the NFT and neither Issuer nor any of its licensors shall have any liability in such
                            circumstances, regardless of cause. You expressly understand and agree that your use of the
                            Platform and any NFTs is at your sole risk and that the Platform and NFTs are provided “as
                            is” and “as available.”</p>

                        </P>All sales of NFTs are final. Once you have made a purchase of an NFT, you should promptly
                        take the necessary steps to complete your transaction (e.g., activate or download any content or
                        secure any seed phrase or corresponding private key). We encourage the use of secure, offline
                        storage measures for NFTs. You may purchase NFTs using real or virtual/cryptocurrency, where
                        multiple payment options are made available to you. You may resell or otherwise transfer an NFT
                        that you Own where this is permitted by these NFT Terms and applicable law. Any sale or transfer
                        must provide for the transfer of all of your rights then outstanding with respect to such NFT.
                        Anyone receiving such NFTs from you agrees to and is bound by these NFT Terms. You are strictly
                        forbidden to sell, swap, donate, give away, transfer, or otherwise dispose of your purchased NFT
                        to any person who is not twenty-one (21) years or older. You agree to comply without limitation

                        altering or creating derivative works (only to the extent permitted) or otherwise dealing with
                        NFTs or using the Platform. Any and all use of NFTs on social media websites and on any websites
                        or in (electronic) media must comply with the Code. We expressly reserve the right to seize,
                        freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any NFT in case of non-compliance with the
                        foregoing.

                            Issuer reserves the right to cancel the applicable Redeemable Elements and deny

                        <p>You acknowledge that NFTs carry the following risks among others. We expressly disclaim any responsibility for these risks.</p>

                        <h4 class="mt-4">7.1 Inherent Risks with Digital Assets</h4>
                        <p>There are risks associated with using Internet-based digital assets such as NFTs and cryptocurrency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorised access to information stored within your electronic wallet. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the BNB and TRON blockchain network, however, caused.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="mt-4"> 7.2 Value/Volatility/Not An Investment</h4>
                        <p>The prices of NFTs can be extremely volatile and subjective, and NFTs have no inherent or intrinsic value. To the extent there is a price or market for a blockchain asset such as an NFT, (a) those prices and markets are extremely volatile, (b) variations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of any digital assets you own, including NFTs, and (c) there is no guarantee that NFTs will have or retain any value. NFTs are not securities or financial instruments and are not offered for investment purposes. The commercial or market value of NFTs may materially diminish in value as a result of a variety of things, including negative publicity associated with the Issuer. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for the risks of engaging in any transactions relating to your NFTs with third parties (e.g., transferring your NFT from a third party on any so-called “secondary market”).</p>

                        <h4 class="mt-4"> 7.3 Use of Blockchain.</h4>
                        <p> The Platform does not store, send, or receive NFTs. This is because NFTs exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the Platform’s supporting blockchain in the BNB and TRON blockchain network. Any transfer of NFTs occurs within the supporting blockchain in the Network, and not on the Platform. We do not make any promises or guarantees about the availability of NFTs or that it will host your or any other NFTs at any specific location and/or for any specific period of time. Upgrades to the BNB and TRON blockchain, a hard fork or other change to the BNB and TRON blockchain, a failure or cessation of the BNB and TRON blockchain or its underlying cryptocurrency, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the BNB and TRON blockchain may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains using those or similar technologies, including the NFTs. We do not make any promises or guarantees related to the BNB and TRON Foundation, the BNB and TRON blockchain, or any other third parties related to the NFTs or the Platform (including any of their respective applications and/or services, as well as to the continued availability of or the protection or storage of any data you provide to those parties). You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any loss of access to your NFTs due to loss of your private key(s), custodial error or purchaser error, mining attacks, hacking, security weaknesses, fraud, counterfeiting, cyberattacks and other technological difficulties.</p>

                        <h4 class="mt-4"> 7.4 Regulatory Uncertainty </h4>
                        <p>The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies and tokens are uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Platform ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of your NFTs. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for the risk of changes to the regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens and new regulations, unfavourable regulatory intervention in one or more jurisdictions or policies any of which may materially adversely affect the use and value of the NFTs.</p>

                        <h4 class="mt-4">7.5 Tax Calculations. </h4>
                        <p>You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your NFT-related transactions. We are not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the Platform or other NFT-related transactions. </p>

                       <h4 class="mt-4"> 7.6 General</h4>
                        <p> You also acknowledge and agree that: (a) you have obtained sufficient information to make an informed decision regarding the NFTs; (b) you are solely responsible for determining the nature, potential value, suitability and appropriateness of these risks for yourself; (c) Issuer does not represent or warrant that any NFTs, or its supporting systems or technology, are reliable, current or error-free or otherwise meets your requirements, that defects in the NFTs, or their supporting systems or technology, will be corrected, or that the delivery mechanism for NFTs will be free of viruses or other harmful components; and (d) Issuer shall not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors or delays you may experience related to the NFTs.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-4">ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING SANCTIONS</h3>
                        <p>Issuer maintains an anti-money laundering (“AML”) program consistent with the requirements applicable to it under the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act. You agree to comply with all related compliance procedures as required by the Issuer from time to time. In addition, if applicable to your own business operations, you shall maintain an AML program consistent with such requirements. You understand, acknowledge, and agree that exports, re-exports and in-country transfers of any NFT, wine or other Redeemable Elements, and related services (individually, an “Item” and, collectively, the “Items”) are subject to U.S. export, import, customs, antiboycott, and economic sanctions laws, regulations, rules, and orders (each, a “Trade Control Law”). You shall not export, re-export, or otherwise transfer or provide any Item in contravention of any Trade Control Law, including to anyone (a) in Cuba, Crimea, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria, or in any other embargoed destination, or (b) listed on, or owned or controlled by anyone on, a sanctioned party list published by the U.S. Departments of Commerce or Treasury, including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (a “Sanctioned Party”). You certify that you are not a Sanctioned Party or located in or a resident of any embargoed destination. In addition to any other remedy that Issuer may have, Issuer may suspend and/or cancel the provision of any Item if Issuer believes, in its discretion, that such activity may violate any Trade Control Law or Issuer’s own compliance policies.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-4">DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY</h3>
                        <p>There is no warranty for the platform or any nfts, to the extent permitted by applicable law. except when otherwise stated in writing, the issuer and/or other parties provide the platform and nfts “as is” without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-4">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
                        <p>Except as required by nonviable provisions of applicable law or agreed to in writing, the issuer (or any licensor) shall not be liable to you or any other party for damages, including any general, special, incidental, punitive or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the platform or any nfts or elements thereof (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties), even if you or other party have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
